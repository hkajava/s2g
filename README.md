# s2g
Students2Groups Meteor application. Noticed in Spanish conversation class that the teacher doesn't have a good method to divide students into small groups for conversation so this application will provide easy way to do that. Also testing Meteor/React technologies with this application.

git clone git@github.com:hkajava/s2g.git
